## Introduction

Here, we explore the history of computing — in particular programming languages —
with the intention of unearthing a better machine abstraction that lends itself
to higher extended abstractions in a natural way.
The primary goal is to design [_A Better C_](/abc).
This — by intention — is to be minimal.

Whether we build abstraction mechanisms baked into the language or we leave
higher abstractions to multiple separate languages is undecided yet.
It would be quite useful to consider how such an arrangement might work.

We are not trying to model human intelligence or the universe.
Instead, we are trying to capture the essential of _Von Neumann Computing_.
The people who want to take over the world by using machines to control
people are interested in money, power and fame.

I just want to design and implement better software systems
with simplicity, elegance and sophistication.
Make life easier for yourself and there may just be others who could
benefit, especially, in the field of software.

It is always healthy to keep in mind that in the end we all die!
