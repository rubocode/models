## Functions

> It is the pervading law of all things organic and inorganic,
> of all things physical and metaphysical,
> of all things human and all things superhuman,
> of all true manifestations of the head, of the heart, of the soul,
> that the life is recognizable in its expression,
> that form ever follows function.
> This is the law.  
> **Louis Henry Sullivan**
